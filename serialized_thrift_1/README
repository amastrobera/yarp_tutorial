# serialized and trasmitted objects in YARP are called IDL
# these objects are declared into a trift file, and code is automatically
# generated to create classes out of it for c++ etc
# http://www.yarp.it/thrift_tutorial_portable.html

# (once defined your structure in the .trift file)
# yarpidl_thrift --gen yarp --out ./ SharedData.trift (to do once)
# build with cmake
# $ yarp server (t1)
# $ ./client (t2)
# $ ./server (t2)
