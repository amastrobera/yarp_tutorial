## YARP Tutorials ##

This repo contains a bunch of tests on YARP robotic platform to learn how to use it. 

Each folder contains a piece of technology, from the simplies \'hello world\' to the more complex patters (client-server and publisher-subscriber), and eventually the YARP serialization of objects (thrift) and serialization of commands (thrift with rpc). 


It also contain two special cases. YARP Python and YARP JS. These ones need YARP to be build/installed from source (rather than from \'apt-get\'). For YARP JS, the binary folder must also be placed in a specific location from which modules can be imported. 


Here is a link on how to [install](http://www.yarp.it/install.html) YARP. And here is another for python, install from [source](http://www.yarp.it/download.html) and install [swig](http://www.yarp.it/yarp_swig.html#yarp_swig_python)
